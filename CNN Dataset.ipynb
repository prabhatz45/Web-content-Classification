The bloc, for financial and strategic reasons, wants to build strong economic ties with Beijing that bolster Brussels' desire to be a serious player on the world stage as the leading light of Western values.The problem is, doing so in any serious way means turning a blind eye to China's well-documented human rights violations.For much of the past decade, the world's largest trading bloc has gone out of its way to establish an economic partnership with Beijing that doesn't conflict too aggressively with Brussels' lofty values. The EU was criticized from both in and outside the bloc when it announced last December the conclusion in principle of negotiations with the Chinese government on its \\\"Comprehensive Agreement on Investment\\\" (CAI).  According to EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, the agreement, if ratified, \\\"will provide unprecedented access to the Chinese market,\\\" while also committing \\\"China to ambitious principles on sustainability, transparency and non-discrimination.\\\" Any agreement like this needs to be approved by the EU's 27 member states and ratified by the European parliament.  Read MorePrecisely how bound China would be to any of the EU's redlines was an immediate cause for concern. \\\"The deal makes statements about human rights and forced labor, but there is no way of forcing China to do anything,\\\" says Samira Rafaela, a member of the EU parliament who sits on the international trade committee.Queen Elizabeth visits UK's largest warship, as it set sails for South China SeaMany of Rafaela's colleagues across the political spectrum clearly agree. Last week, the parliament voted on a motion to freeze the CAI until further notice. Ostensibly, this was in protest at China placing sanctions on five MEPs who had criticized China's treatment of Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang among other things.  However, in reality the sanctions were really the final straw for some who couldn't stomach Brussels striking a friendly deal with a government in Beijing that allegedly imprisons people in forced labor camps, undermines democracy in Hong Kong and is increasingly hostile in its own region.  \\\"The statement we are sending with this motion isn't simply, if China lifts the sanctions then CAI is back on the table,\\\" says Reinhard B\\u00fctikofer, chair of the parliament's delegation on China relations. \\\"If sanctions are lifted, we will look at the detail, but it's currently far from satisfactory. It's weak on forced labor, weak on sustainability, weak on dispute resolutions. These problems will still exist even if we resurrect the agreement.\\\"  Given the chances of China lifting these sanctions any time soon is virtually zero, this creates a problem for the top brass in the EU Commission, who have invested a lot of political capital in the deal.   For the EU's increasingly political executive branch, China formed a key part of its plan to become a bigger player on the global stage and become diplomatically independent of its most important ally: the United States. \\\"Strategic autonomy,\\\" as Brussels calls it, has been a priority for EU officials who are concerned about Europe's inherent vulnerabilities, be they from Russian aggression in the east, over-reliance on China for medical supplies or the risk of another president like Donald Trump pulling American troops out of Europe.  \\\"The China agreement was a big plank in that strategy,\\\" says Steven Blockmans, director of research at the Centre for European Policy Studies. \\\"If the Chinese and European parliament don't move, the EU risks losing a deal that would have cemented the idea it can make decisions to defend its own commercial interests, without having to call the White House first.\\\" Despite the European parliament's protests, the commission still thinks the deal is right for the EU. Officials who spoke with CNN explained that they understood the parliament's concerns and that the political conditions didn't exist at the moment. One official even lauded the parliament's action, saying it provided proof that \\\"economic interests will not prevent the EU from standing up for human rights.\\\" However, they also said this was a rare window of opportunity to get China committing to something on paper, and that window could run out for political reasons -- most notably after upcoming elections in France and Germany, the two member states most supportive of the deal.  It's at member state level that the apparent split between parliament and commission gets interesting. It's been known for some time that locking in some kind of formal relationship with China was a big priority for Angela Merkel as she tries to nail down her legacy. The German Chancellor will stand down after 16 years in power this autumn, as Germany holds federal elections.  Chinese Premier Li Keqiang (R) and German Chancellor Angela Merkel attend a joint news conference at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on May 24, 2018. As things stand, it's likely that Merkel's party -- no longer with a leader who holds as much political capital as her -- will have to enter a coalition with the anti-Beijing Greens. This could significantly soften German support for the deal.  The other key sponsor of the deal was French President Emmanuel Macron, a man who also faces re-election next year. The fact that Macron's biggest rival is far-right Marine Le Pen has led some to think he might, in the coming months, cool on globalist policies.  As for the other member states, diplomats who spoke to CNN pointed out that the CAI is not a full trade deal and that there was no urgent need to rush anything through. As one diplomat put it, \\\"there is an awakening in Europe about the real character of its relationship with China and governments don't like it. This will be parked for a while is my guess.\\\" The commission remains convinced that its political capital was well spent and that member states will ultimately choose their economies over other priorities. \\\"Even if leadership changes, the economic reality in Germany and France isn't going to change, and economics has a habit of trumping other concerns,\\\" the diplomat said.   Philippe Lamberts, a senior Belgian MEP, disagrees: \\\"I think EU-China relations are going to get worse before they get better. Even if they lift their sanctions, what message does it send on European values if we agree a deal with such weak provisions on human rights, democracy and sustainability?\\\"  The EU's record on human rights, critics argue, is already patchy. While last week the European parliament did stand up to both China and Turkey -- calling for the suspension of talks with Ankara to join the bloc over its own human rights record -- campaigners say that the EU is not doing enough to uphold its own standards on human records inside or outside the bloc.  Chinese President Xi Jinping and French Emmanuel Macron (taste wine as they visit France's pavilion during the China International Import Expo in Shanghai on November 5, 2019.\\\"Trade and investment are an area where economic interests have always prevailed over respect for human rights, as much as security concerns have always prevailed in migration management,\\\" says Elena Crespi, program officer for Western Europe at the International Federation for Human Rights.  And while the parliament has a good track record on human rights, awarding its Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to an imprisoned Uyghur scholar in 2019, critics believe the commission falls short in comparison.  \\\"The current commission is not sufficiently doing its job in upholding European values,\\\" says Alice Stollmeyer, executive director of Defend Democracy. \\\"Whether it's fudging on rule of law in Hungary and Poland or failing to properly speak out against atrocities elsewhere, the EU sadly seems to have a policy of appeasement for abusers.\\\" It's no secret that the EU is in a transitional phase. Those at the center of the project see a future of closer union and its officials in Brussels becoming serious players on the world stage in their own right.

The bloc, for financial and strategic reasons, wants to build strong economic ties with Beijing that bolster Brussels' desire to be a serious player on the world stage as the leading light of Western values.  (CNN)The European Union has a China problem. The bloc, for financial and strategic reasons, wants to build strong economic ties with Beijing that bolster Brussels' desire to be a serious player on the world stage as the leading light of Western values.The problem is, doing so in any serious way means turning a blind eye to China's well-documented human rights violations.For much of the past decade, the world's largest trading bloc has gone out of its way to establish an economic partnership with Beijing that doesn't conflict too aggressively with Brussels' lofty values. The EU was criticized from both in and outside the bloc when it announced last December the conclusion in principle of negotiations with the Chinese government on its \\\"Comprehensive Agreement on Investment\\\" (CAI).  According to EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, the agreement, if ratified, \\\"will provide unprecedented access to the Chinese market,\\\" while also committing \\\"China to ambitious principles on sustainability, transparency and non-discrimination.\\\" Any agreement like this needs to be approved by the EU's 27 member states and ratified by the European parliament.  Read MorePrecisely how bound China would be to any of the EU's redlines was an immediate cause for concern. \\\"The deal makes statements about human rights and forced labor, but there is no way of forcing China to do anything,\\\" says Samira Rafaela, a member of the EU parliament who sits on the international trade committee.Queen Elizabeth visits UK's largest warship, as it set sails for South China SeaMany of Rafaela's colleagues across the political spectrum clearly agree. Last week, the parliament voted on a motion to freeze the CAI until further notice. Ostensibly, this was in protest at China placing sanctions on five MEPs who had criticized China's treatment of Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang among other things.  However, in reality the sanctions were really the final straw for some who couldn't stomach Brussels striking a friendly deal with a government in Beijing that allegedly imprisons people in forced labor camps, undermines democracy in Hong Kong and is increasingly hostile in its own region.  \\\"The statement we are sending with this motion isn't simply, if China lifts the sanctions then CAI is back on the table,\\\" says Reinhard B\\u00fctikofer, chair of the parliament's delegation on China relations. \\\"If sanctions are lifted, we will look at the detail, but it's currently far from satisfactory. It's weak on forced labor, weak on sustainability, weak on dispute resolutions. These problems will still exist even if we resurrect the agreement.\\\"  Given the chances of China lifting these sanctions any time soon is virtually zero, this creates a problem for the top brass in the EU Commission, who have invested a lot of political capital in the deal.   For the EU's increasingly political executive branch, China formed a key part of its plan to become a bigger player on the global stage and become diplomatically independent of its most important ally: the United States. \\\"Strategic autonomy,\\\" as Brussels calls it, has been a priority for EU officials who are concerned about Europe's inherent vulnerabilities, be they from Russian aggression in the east, over-reliance on China for medical supplies or the risk of another president like Donald Trump pulling American troops out of Europe.  \\\"The China agreement was a big plank in that strategy,\\\" says Steven Blockmans, director of research at the Centre for European Policy Studies. \\\"If the Chinese and European parliament don't move, the EU risks losing a deal that would have cemented the idea it can make decisions to defend its own commercial interests, without having to call the White House first.\\\" Despite the European parliament's protests, the commission still thinks the deal is right for the EU. Officials who spoke with CNN explained that they understood the parliament's concerns and that the political conditions didn't exist at the moment. One official even lauded the parliament's action, saying it provided proof that \\\"economic interests will not prevent the EU from standing up for human rights.\\\" However, they also said this was a rare window of opportunity to get China committing to something on paper, and that window could run out for political reasons -- most notably after upcoming elections in France and Germany, the two member states most supportive of the deal.  It's at member state level that the apparent split between parliament and commission gets interesting. It's been known for some time that locking in some kind of formal relationship with China was a big priority for Angela Merkel as she tries to nail down her legacy. The German Chancellor will stand down after 16 years in power this autumn, as Germany holds federal elections.  Chinese Premier Li Keqiang (R) and German Chancellor Angela Merkel attend a joint news conference at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on May 24, 2018. As things stand, it's likely that Merkel's party -- no longer with a leader who holds as much political capital as her -- will have to enter a coalition with the anti-Beijing Greens. This could significantly soften German support for the deal.  The other key sponsor of the deal was French President Emmanuel Macron, a man who also faces re-election next year. The fact that Macron's biggest rival is far-right Marine Le Pen has led some to think he might, in the coming months, cool on globalist policies.  As for the other member states, diplomats who spoke to CNN pointed out that the CAI is not a full trade deal and that there was no urgent need to rush anything through. As one diplomat put it, \\\"there is an awakening in Europe about the real character of its relationship with China and governments don't like it. This will be parked for a while is my guess.\\\" The commission remains convinced that its political capital was well spent and that member states will ultimately choose their economies over other priorities. \\\"Even if leadership changes, the economic reality in Germany and France isn't going to change, and economics has a habit of trumping other concerns,\\\" the diplomat said.   Philippe Lamberts, a senior Belgian MEP, disagrees: \\\"I think EU-China relations are going to get worse before they get better. Even if they lift their sanctions, what message does it send on European values if we agree a deal with such weak provisions on human rights, democracy and sustainability?\\\"  The EU's record on human rights, critics argue, is already patchy. While last week the European parliament did stand up to both China and Turkey -- calling for the suspension of talks with Ankara to join the bloc over its own human rights record -- campaigners say that the EU is not doing enough to uphold its own standards on human records inside or outside the bloc.  Chinese President Xi Jinping and French Emmanuel Macron (taste wine as they visit France's pavilion during the China International Import Expo in Shanghai on November 5, 2019.\\\"Trade and investment are an area where economic interests have always prevailed over respect for human rights, as much as security concerns have always prevailed in migration management,\\\" says Elena Crespi, program officer for Western Europe at the International Federation for Human Rights.  And while the parliament has a good track record on human rights, awarding its Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to an imprisoned Uyghur scholar in 2019, critics believe the commission falls short in comparison.  \\\"The current commission is not sufficiently doing its job in upholding European values,\\\" says Alice Stollmeyer, executive director of Defend Democracy. \\\"Whether it's fudging on rule of law in Hungary and Poland or failing to properly speak out against atrocities elsewhere, the EU sadly seems to have a policy of appeasement for abusers.\\\" It's no secret that the EU is in a transitional phase. Those at the center of the project see a future of closer union and its officials in Brussels becoming serious players on the world stage in their own right.  If a balanced relationship with China was indeed central to this, the current mood among elected politicians across the member states will be of serious concern to the Brussels elite.  Perhaps more worrying, Blockmans points out, is whether China reassesses how much it wants a deal with the bloc. \\\"It might be that China still sees the EU as a secondary player -- a lackey to the US. If that's that case, they might decide that this is a deal worth collapsing for their own political ends.\\\"  Regardless, the point is moot while Europe's political class refuses to even look at this deal. The longer this deadlock on sanctions goes on, the greater the chance it totally collapses. And it if does, those at the top table in Brussels might regret investing so much political capital in dealing with one of the world's worst human rights offenders.  \",\n          \"Sadio Mane donates $693,000 to fund hospital in his hometown in Senegal - CNN Senegal and Liverpool football star Sadio Mane has donated $693,000 (\\u00a3500,000) to help fund the construction of a hospital in his hometown of Bambali in Senegal.

In the last 100 years, no named storm had ever developed east of Bermuda in the month of May. Tropical Storm Ana broke that record. Typically, storms during this month form over the eastern Gulf of Mexico, western Caribbean Sea and near the southeastern US coast.Another unique storm was Subtropical Storm Teresa. Reports of subtropical storms are not uncommon, especially in the 21st century, thanks to advanced technology. What is uncommon is for a storm to remain subtropical for its entire life, never transitioning to \\\"tropical\\\" status. Teresa was also extremely short-lived, at only 24 hours. Subtropical Storm Teresa formed on Friday, September 24, at 5 p.m. Atlantic Standard Time. Exactly 24 hours later, the NHC issued its final advisory as Teresa became a remnant, low-pressure system. Ida will likely be the only name on the retired list this year, despite there being three other major hurricanes, simply because of the amount of damage and fatalities caused. The letter \\\"I\\\" already has more retired names than any other letter in the alphabet. There are already 12 retired storm names that start with the letter \\\"I\\\", and Ida will likely become the 13th.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n

strategic reasons wants to build strong economic ties with beijing that bolster brussels desire to be a serious player on the world stage as the leading light of western valuesthe problem is doing so in any serious way means turning a blind eye to chinas welldocumented human rights violationsfor much of the past decade the worlds largest trading bloc has gone out of its way to establish an economic partnership with beijing that doesnt conflict too aggressively with brussels lofty values the eu was criticized from both in and outside the bloc when it announced last december the conclusion in principle of negotiations with the chinese government on its comprehensive agreement on investment cai according to eu commission president ursula von der leyen the agreement if ratified will provide unprecedented access to the chinese market while also committing china to ambitious principles on sustainability transparency and nondiscrimination any agreement like this needs to be approved by the eus member states and ratified by the european parliament read moreprecisely how bound china would be to any of the eus redlines was an immediate cause for concern the deal makes statements about human rights and forced labor but there is no way of forcing china to do anything says samira rafaela a member of the eu parliament who sits on the international trade committeequeen elizabeth visits uks largest warship as it set sails for south china seamany of rafaelas colleagues across the political spectrum clearly agree last week the parliament voted on a motion to freeze the cai until further notice ostensibly this was in protest at china placing sanctions on five meps who had criticized chinas treatment of muslim uyghurs in xinjiang among other things however in reality the sanctions were really the final straw for some who couldnt stomach brussels striking a friendly deal with a government in beijing that allegedly imprisons people in forced labor camps undermines democracy in hong kong and is increasingly hostile in its own region the statement we are sending with this motion isnt simply if china lifts the sanctions then cai is back on the table says reinhard btikofer chair of the parliaments delegation on china relations if sanctions are lifted we will look at the detail but its currently far from satisfactory its weak on forced labor weak on sustainability weak on dispute resolutions these problems will still exist even if we resurrect the agreement given the chances of china lifting these sanctions any time soon is virtually zero this creates a problem for the top brass in the eu commission who have invested a lot of political capital in the deal for the eus increasingly political executive branch china formed a key part of its plan to become a bigger player on the global stage and become diplomatically independent of its most important ally the united states strategic autonomy as brussels calls it has been a priority for eu officials who are concerned about europes inherent vulnerabilities be they from russian aggression in the east overreliance on china for medical supplies or the risk of another president like donald trump pulling american troops out of europe the china agreement was a big plank in that strategy says steven blockmans director of research at the centre for european policy studies if the chinese and european parliament dont move the eu risks losing a deal that would have cemented the idea it can make decisions to defend its own commercial interests without having to call the white house first despite the european parliaments protests the commission still thinks the deal is right for the eu officials who spoke with cnn explained that they understood the parliaments concerns and that the political conditions didnt exist at the moment one official even lauded the parliaments action saying it provided proof that economic interests will not prevent the eu from standing up for human rights however they also said this was a rare window of opportunity to get china committing to something on paper and that window could run out for political reasons most notably after upcoming elections in france and germany the two member states most supportive of the deal its at member state level that the apparent split between parliament and commission gets interesting its been known for some time that locking in some kind of formal relationship with china was a big priority for angela merkel as she tries to nail down her legacy the german chancellor will stand down after years in power this autumn as germany holds federal elections chinese premier li keqiang r and german chancellor angela merkel attend a joint news conference at the great hall of the people in beijing on may as things stand its likely that merkels party no longer with a leader who holds as much political capital as her will have to enter a coalition with the antibeijing greens this could significantly soften german support for the deal the other key sponsor of the deal was french president emmanuel macron a man who also faces reelection next year the fact that macrons biggest rival is farright marine le pen has led some to think he might in the coming months cool on globalist policies as for the other member states diplomats who spoke to cnn pointed out that the cai is not a full trade deal and that there was no urgent need to rush anything through as one diplomat put it there is an awakening in europe about the real character of its relationship with china and governments dont like it this will be parked for a while is my guess the commission remains convinced that its political capital was well spent and that member states will ultimately choose their economies over other priorities even if leadership changes the economic reality in germany and france isnt going to change and economics has a habit of trumping other concerns the diplomat said philippe lamberts a senior belgian mep disagrees i think euchina relations are going to get worse before they get better even if they lift their sanctions what message does it send on european values if we agree a deal with such weak provisions on human rights democracy and sustainability the eus record on human rights critics argue is already patchy while last week the european parliament did stand up to both china and turkey calling for the suspension of talks with ankara to join the bloc over its own human rights record campaigners say that the eu is not doing enough to uphold its own standards on human records inside or outside the bloc chinese president xi jinping and french emmanuel macron taste wine as they visit frances pavilion during the china international import expo in shanghai on november trade and investment are an area where economic interests have always prevailed over respect for human rights as much as security concerns have always prevailed in migration management says elena crespi program officer for western europe at the international federation for human rights and while the parliament has a good track record on human rights awarding its sakharov prize for freedom of thought to an imprisoned uyghur scholar in critics believe the commission falls short in comparison the current commission is not sufficiently doing its job in upholding european values says alice stollmeyer executive director of defend democracy whether its fudging on rule of law in hungary and poland or failing to properly speak out against atrocities elsewhere the eu sadly seems to have a policy of appeasement for abusers its no secret that the eu is in a transitional phase those at the center of the project see a future of closer union and its officials in brussels becoming serious players on the world stage in their own right if a balanced relationship with china was indeed central to this the current mood among elected politicians across the member states will be of serious concern to the brussels elite perhaps more worrying blockmans points out is whether china reassesses how much it wants a deal with the bloc it might be that china still sees the eu as a secondary player a lackey to the us if thats that case they might decide that this is a deal worth collapsing for their own political ends regardless the point is moot while europes political class refuses to even look at this deal the longer this deadlock on sanctions goes on the greater the chance it totally collapses and it if does those at the top table in brussels might regret investing so much political capital in

interrupts live Russian state news broadcast to denounce invasion of Ukraine - CNN A woman holding a sign reading \"NO WAR\" interrupted a live news broadcast on Russian state television Monday to denounce Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine.   (CNN Business)A woman holding a sign reading \"NO WAR\" interrupted a live news broadcast on Russian state television Monday to denounce Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine. \"Stop the war. Do not believe propaganda they tell you lies here,\" the sign reads. \"Russians against war,\" the last line of the sign says in English.The woman who carried out the bold act of defiance was identified as Maria Ovsyannikova, an employee of Russia Channel One, according to OVD-Info, an independent human rights protest-monitoring group. The outlet\\'s content is tightly controlled by the Russian government.China has expressed some openness to providing military and financial aid to Russia, US cable suggestsCNN cannot independently verify the woman holding the sign is Ovsyannikova, but photos on social media profiles bearing her name match the woman seen on screen.Russian state news agency TASS confirmed OVD-Info\\'s reporting, citing a source, and added that she could face prosecution.Read MoreFriends of Ovsyannikova told OVD-Info she was at the Ostankino Police Department in Moscow, but her lawyer, Dmitry Zakhvatov, later told CNN he couldn\\'t locate her. \"We didn\\'t find her for now, but we are continuing to search,\" Zakhvatov said.The act of protest came nearly three weeks after Russia invaded neighboring Ukraine, setting off a humanitarian disaster in the country and triggering the greatest security crisis in Europe since the Cold War. Satellite images show widespread destruction from Russian bombings across Ukraine, including the major cities of Kyiv and Mariupol. More than 2,500 civilians have died in Mariupol alone, Ukrainian officials estimate. More than 2.8 million residents have fled the country since the invasion began, according to United Nations refugee estimates.

This man is Vladimir Putin,\" Ovsyannikova says in the video, noting that her father is Ukrainian, and her mother is Russian. What does Putin want in Ukraine? The conflict explained\"Unfortunately, for the past few years, I have been working on Channel One and doing Kremlin propaganda, and now I am very ashamed of it,\" she says in the video. \"It\\'s a shame that I allowed to speak lies from the TV screens, ashamed that I allowed to zombify Russian people.\"\"I am ashamed that we kept silent in 2014, when all this was just beginning,\" she says, a reference to Russia\\'s 2014 invasion of Ukraine that resulted in the annexation of Crimea. \"We didn\\'t go to rallies when the Kremlin poisoned Navalny, we just silently watched this anti-human regime and now the world has turned its back on us forever, and another ten generations of our descendants will not be able to wash away from the shame of this fraternal war.\"\"We are Russian people, thinking and smart, and it is only in our power to stop all this madness,\" she says. \"Go to the rallies and do not be afraid! They can\\'t transplant us all!\"Videos of the interruption were quickly posted on social media after it aired. CNN obtained the video from a live feed of Russia Channel One VK\\'s profile.
